# Advent of code 2017

Me trying to solve [AoC 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
Most important goal is to create idiomatic Rust code here (if I'll have enough time for that).

Also learn some stuff.

## Running (nightly only)

1. Run tests suite for all days

```bash
cargo test
```

2. Run tests suite for a specific day

```bash
cargo test day01
```

3. Run specific day solver

```bash
cargo run --bin day01
```
