# Advent of code 2017

Me trying to solve [AoC 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
Most important goal is to create idiomatic Rust code here. Also learn some stuff.

## Running

1. Run tests suite for all days

```bash
cargo test
```

2. Run specific day solver

```bash
cargo run --bin day-01
```

## Results

1. Inverse Captcha - Learn iterators the hard way
